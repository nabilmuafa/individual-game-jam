# Individual Game Jam - Plan A

This game is developed as a part of the Individual Game Jam assignment from CSCE604021 Game Development course in Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia.

Plan A is not the title of the game; it is _quite literally_ plan A. In case my idealism doesn't work, please check the plan B branch (to be developed) that will have a working game that's, of course, less idealistic, but hey, it works! It..._will_ work?

_Author's sidenote: When I was writing this, the thought suddenly came to mind: What if the game title \*is\* Plan A? We'll see how well this idea can be implemented later. LONG LIVE IDEALISM!_

## What?

A 2D top-down perspective survival game. Semi-open world, with a smaller scope and shorter gameplay. I don't got all the time in the world; I started the development with 17 days left before the deadline.

You're playing as [ENTER PROTAGONIST NAME LATER]. You woke up stranded in an island you don't recognize...or so you think. You don't have any memory of what happened, but there are fragments of your memory scratching that part of your brain that has high curiosity. Explore the island to survive and to discover the events that led you to the island.

_Author's sidenote: I still want to find something, a feature or a mechanic that's antimainstream and not just 2D Minecraft. Will be added to the description if I found one._

## Diversifiers

- Inventory: Player has an inventory that can be used to access items they've taken along the way.
- Stranded: The player wakes up in a remote island, having no memory of what led him there. Wait, is it a remote island, though?
- **[TODO]** Previously, I've chosen _Archive_ as the third diversifier, but I don't think it would be good enough for a short game that will mainly be hosted on Itch. I'm choosing another. _Still_ choosing another.
