# Individual Game Jam - Escape From A Short Escape

This game is developed as a part of the Individual Game Jam assignment from CSCE604021 Game Development course in Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia.

## What?

A 2D top-down perspective survival game. Semi-open world, with a smaller scope and shorter gameplay.

You're playing as The Protagonist, who luckily is a wildlife expert, so you know a lot of stuff about survival. You woke up stranded in an island you don't recognize. You don't have any memory of what led to you being stranded, but you know you can't stay too long in this island, especially on a thunderstorm. Explore the island to survive and to escape the island.

## Diversifiers

- Inventory: Player has an inventory that can be used to access items they've taken along the way.
- Stranded: The player wakes up in a remote island, having no memory of what led him there. Wait, is it a remote island, though?
- **[TODO]** Previously, I've chosen _Archive_ as the third diversifier, but I don't think it would be good enough for a short game that will mainly be hosted on Itch. I'm choosing another. _Still_ choosing another.
