# Individual Game Jam - Escape From A Short Escape

This game is developed as a part of the Individual Game Jam assignment from CSCE604021 Game Development course in Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia.

## What?

A 2D top-down perspective survival game. Semi-open world, with a smaller scope and shorter gameplay.

You're playing as The Protagonist, who luckily is a wildlife expert, so you know a lot of stuff about survival. You woke up stranded in an island you don't recognize. You don't have any memory of what led to you being stranded, but you know you can't stay too long in this island, especially on a thunderstorm. Explore the island to survive and to escape the island.

## Diversifiers

- Bored Ape: Collecting something is the main objective of the game. In this game, the item being collected are the resources needed to escape.
- Inventory: The player has an inventory system. Additionally, the player can also craft some things.
- Stranded: The player is stranded in a remote island and have to survive.
